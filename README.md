# Hand Digit Recognition with Multilayer Perceptron

A simple yet powerful **neural network model** that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** built from scratch in Python.  
This project demonstrates how neural networks learn to classify images without using high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

---

## Overview

This project implements a **feedforward neural network** to classify digits from the **MNIST dataset** â€” a classic benchmark in computer vision.  
The model is built **from scratch**, meaning the forward propagation, activation functions, backpropagation, and weight updates are **implemented manually** using only **NumPy**.

## Features

- Implementation of **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** using NumPy  
- **Forward & Backward propagation** coded manually  
- Supports **mini-batch gradient descent**   
- Visualization of **accuracy and loss curves**  
- Evaluation on **MNIST test set**
